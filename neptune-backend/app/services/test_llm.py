    {"id": "note1", "content": "The fundamental theorem of calculus establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, the two main operations in calculus. It states that if f is continuous on [a, b] and F is an antiderivative of f, then the definite integral of f from a to b equals F(b) - F(a). When working with limits, we often use the epsilon-delta definition: A function f(x) approaches the limit L as x approaches a if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε. Derivatives represent instantaneous rates of change. The power rule states that if f(x) = xⁿ, then f'(x) = nxⁿ⁻¹. The chain rule allows us to differentiate composite functions: if f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x)) · h'(x). Integration techniques include substitution, integration by parts, and partial fractions. For example, the formula for integration by parts is ∫u(x)v'(x)dx = u(x)v(x) - ∫v(x)u'(x)dx. Applications of calculus include optimization problems, related rates, and calculating areas under curves. In physics, calculus helps us understand motion, electromagnetic fields, and fluid dynamics."},
    {"id": "note2", "content": "The European Theater of World War II began with Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, triggering declarations of war from Britain and France. The German Blitzkrieg (""lightning war"") strategy utilized fast-moving armor, mechanized infantry, and air power to overwhelm opponents quickly. After conquering much of Western Europe, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 1941, initially gaining significant territory before Soviet resistance stiffened. The Battle of Stalingrad from August 1942 to February 1943 marked a turning point, resulting in the destruction of Germany's Sixth Army and beginning the Soviet push westward. D-Day (June 6, 1944) saw Allied forces under General Eisenhower land on the beaches of Normandy in history's largest amphibious invasion, establishing a foothold in Nazi-occupied Western Europe. The Battle of the Bulge was Hitler's final major offensive in December 1944, creating a ""bulge"" in Allied lines before being repelled. Allied bombing campaigns targeted German industrial centers and infrastructure, culminating in the controversial firebombing of Dresden in February 1945. Soviet forces captured Berlin in April-May 1945 after fierce street-by-street fighting, while Hitler committed suicide in his bunker on April 30. Germany's unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945 (V-E Day) ended the European conflict. The aftermath saw Europe divided between Western Allies and Soviet spheres of influence, setting the stage for the Cold War that would dominate international relations for decades."},
    {"id": "note3", "content": "Multivariable calculus extends the concepts of single-variable calculus to functions of several variables. Partial derivatives represent the rate at which a function changes with respect to one variable while others remain constant, denoted as ∂f/∂x. The gradient vector ∇f points in the direction of greatest rate of increase of the function and is composed of all partial derivatives. Directional derivatives measure rates of change in specified directions, calculated as the dot product of the gradient with a unit vector. Double and triple integrals allow us to calculate volumes and masses over regions in two and three dimensions. The divergence of a vector field measures how much the field ""spreads out"" from a point, while curl measures rotation. Green's theorem connects line integrals and double integrals in the plane. Stokes' theorem generalizes this to three dimensions, relating surface integrals of curl to line integrals. The divergence theorem (Gauss's theorem) relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the triple integral of the divergence. Applications of multivariable calculus include fluid dynamics, electromagnetic theory, optimization problems, and thermodynamics. In economics, multivariable calculus helps analyze production functions and utility maximization under constraints."},
    {"id": "note4", "content": "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert nutrients into ATP, the energy currency of the cell. This process occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules. During aerobic respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondria where it's converted to acetyl-CoA. The Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle) takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. For each glucose molecule, the cycle runs twice, producing 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH₂ molecules. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH and FADH₂ pass through the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. This process yields approximately 28 ATP molecules. Fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen. Lactic acid fermentation, common in muscle cells during intense activity, converts pyruvate to lactate. Alcoholic fermentation, used by yeast, produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis complements cellular respiration by converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Plants use this glucose for their own cellular respiration."},
    {"id": "note5", "content": "Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical mechanics, quantum theory introduces probabilistic interpretations and wave-particle duality. The Schrödinger equation is fundamental to quantum mechanics: iħ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ, where Ψ is the wave function, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator. Solutions to this equation describe the quantum state of a system. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. Mathematically, this is expressed as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, where Δx is position uncertainty and Δp is momentum uncertainty. Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in ways that cannot be explained by classical physics, even when separated by large distances. Einstein referred to this as ""spooky action at a distance."" Quantum superposition suggests that particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This is illustrated by the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until observed. Quantum computing leverages these principles to perform calculations using qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to superposition, potentially solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers."},
    {"id": "note6", "content": "Shakespearean tragedies follow a distinct structure and feature common elements that have influenced literature for centuries. These plays typically revolve around a protagonist of high status whose downfall is caused by a tragic flaw (hamartia). Hamlet exemplifies the complexity of Shakespeare's tragic heroes. His fatal flaw—indecisiveness and overthinking—delays his revenge against Claudius, ultimately leading to multiple deaths, including his own. The famous ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy highlights his psychological depth. Macbeth portrays ambition as a destructive force. Influenced by supernatural prophecies and Lady Macbeth's manipulation, Macbeth's ambition drives him to murder King Duncan. His subsequent paranoia and guilt manifest as hallucinations, including the ghost of Banquo and the famous ""Out, damned spot"" scene. King Lear explores themes of power, family loyalty, and madness. Lear's pride and poor judgment in dividing his kingdom lead to his tragic downfall. The storm scene symbolizes his internal turmoil as he descends into madness after being betrayed by his daughters Goneril and Regan. Othello demonstrates how jealousy can corrupt even the noblest character. Manipulated by Iago's deception, Othello's jealousy transforms him from a respected general to a murderer who kills his innocent wife Desdemona. Shakespeare uses dramatic irony, as the audience knows Iago's true intentions while Othello remains blind to them."},
    {"id": "note7", "content": "The Pacific Theater of World War II began with Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which President Roosevelt called ""a date which will live in infamy."" This attack destroyed much of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and brought the United States into the war. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 marked a turning point in the Pacific War. Despite being outnumbered, U.S. forces sank four Japanese aircraft carriers and damaged their naval aviation capabilities. This victory halted Japanese expansion and gave the Allies a strategic advantage. Island hopping became the primary American strategy in the Pacific. Rather than attacking every Japanese-held island, Allied forces targeted strategically important locations, bypassing heavily fortified positions. This approach minimized casualties while cutting off Japanese supply lines. The Battle of Iwo Jima from February to March 1945 was one of the bloodiest engagements. American forces suffered over 26,000 casualties capturing this small island, which provided an emergency landing strip for B-29 bombers. The iconic photograph of Marines raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi became a symbol of American resolve. The decision to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 remains controversial. Proponents argue it prevented a costly invasion of Japan that might have resulted in millions of casualties. Critics question the necessity and morality of using such devastating weapons against civilian populations. Japan's formal surrender on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay brought World War II to a close. The aftermath saw the American occupation of Japan under General Douglas MacArthur, who oversaw the country's transition to democracy and helped rebuild its economy."},
    {"id": "note8", "content": "Statistics provides essential tools for analyzing data and making inferences about populations based on sample information. Probability distributions form the mathematical foundation of statistics, with the normal distribution being particularly important due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality regardless of the original population distribution as sample size increases. The calculation of probabilities for continuous random variables requires integration, directly connecting statistics to calculus through expressions like P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx, where f(x) is the probability density function. Regression analysis uses calculus to minimize the sum of squared errors through derivatives; setting the derivative of the error function to zero allows us to find the optimal parameter values. Maximum likelihood estimation, a cornerstone method in statistical inference, involves maximizing the likelihood function L(θ|x) by taking derivatives and solving equations of the form d/dθ ln L(θ|x) = 0. Hypothesis testing frameworks rely on probability calculations that often require integration to find areas under curves representing sampling distributions. Bayesian statistics involves the calculation of posterior distributions through Bayes' theorem: P(θ|x) ∝ P(x|θ)P(θ), where the normalization constant requires integration over the parameter space. Time series analysis employs techniques like exponential smoothing and ARIMA models to identify patterns in sequential data, with autocorrelation functions quantifying the relationship between observations at different time points. Statistical moments—mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis—provide information about a distribution's center, spread, and shape, with moment-generating functions M(t) = E[eᵗˣ] offering a powerful tool for deriving these properties through repeated differentiation. Multivariate statistics extends these concepts to multiple dimensions, requiring partial derivatives and multiple integrals similar to multivariable calculus. Non-parametric methods like the bootstrap and permutation tests offer alternatives when distributional assumptions are questionable, using computational resampling rather than analytic solutions. Modern computational statistics relies on algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which use probabilistic approaches to approximate complex integrals that are analytically intractable."}
